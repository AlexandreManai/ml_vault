# Introduction

The Least Squares method is a foundational approach used in regression analysis to find the best-fitting model to data. This method works by minimizing the sum of the squares of the differences (residuals) between observed values and those predicted by the model.

# Definitions

- **Least Squares**: A statistical method used to determine the best fit line or curve by minimizing the sum of squares of the residuals.
$$ S = \sum_{i=1}^{n} r_i^2$$ where $n$ is the number of data points
- **Residuals**: The differences between observed values and the values predicted by the regression model. 
$$r_i = y_i - f(x_i, \beta)$$ where $\beta$ is a vector of parameters 
- **Regression**: A method in statistics used to predict the value of a dependent variable based on the values of one or more independent variables.

# Key Concepts

- **Minimization of Error**: The goal of the Least Squares method is to minimize the sum of the squares of the residuals.
- **Fit Quality**: The quality of a fit is assessed based on how small the sum of the squared residuals is, with smaller values indicating a better fit.
- **Applicability**: This method can be applied to simple linear regression, multivariate regression, and polynomial regression.

# Algorithms/Methods

- **Normal Equation**: For linear regression, the normal equation computes the coefficients that minimize the sum of the squared residuals directly.
- **Gradient Descent**: An iterative optimization algorithm used when the normal equation is computationally impractical.

# Challenges

- **[[Outliers]]**: Outliers can have a disproportionately large effect on the fit because they can significantly increase the sum of the squared residuals.
- **[[Non-linearity]]**: The Least Squares method assumes that the relationship between variables is linear, which may not hold in all cases.
- **[[Multicollinearity]]**: In multivariate regression, high correlations among predictors can lead to unstable estimates of the coefficients.

# Further Reading and Resources

- ["The Elements of Statistical Learning" by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-84858-7) provides a deep dive into regression models, including those based on the Least Squares method.
- Online platforms like Coursera and edX offer courses in statistics and machine learning where the Least Squares method is thoroughly explained and demonstrated.
- Software implementations in R, Python, and MATLAB often include built-in functions for applying the Least Squares method to data analysis problems.
