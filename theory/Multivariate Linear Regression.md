# Introduction

* Multivariate Linear Regression is an extension of simple linear regression to predict an outcome based on multiple predictors.
* This model incorporates several independent variables that influence the dependent variable.
* It is widely used in areas where multiple variables affect a response variable, such as economics, consumer behavior, and health sciences.

# Definitions
- **Dependent Variable (y)**: The variable that is being predicted or estimated.
- **Independent Variables (x1, x2, ..., xn)**: Variables that are used to predict the value of the dependent variable.
- **Error Term ($\epsilon$)**: The difference between the actual and predicted values, indicating the unpredictability or noise.

# Key Concepts
- **Equation of a Line**: $y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + \dots + b_nx_n$ where $b_0, b_1, \dots, b_n$ are coefficients.
- **Best Fit Plane/Line**: The model that best represents the observed data according to the least squares criterion.
- **Multicollinearity**: The occurrence of high intercorrelations among independent variables in a multiple regression model.

# Algorithms/Methods
- [[Least Squares Method]]

# Challenges
- Handling multicollinearity which can make the model unstable and the coefficients difficult to interpret.
- Feature selection to determine the most impactful variables.
- Scaling and normalization of data to ensure fair representation of all variables.
