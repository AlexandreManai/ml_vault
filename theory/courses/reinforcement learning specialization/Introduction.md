## Differences between the paradigms of ML
- Supervised Learning = Learning from labelled data ( telling you the right answer)
- Unsupervised Learning = Learning from unlabelled data / patterns ( showing the right answer)
-->  Both techniques can be used to aid generalization in RL
- Reinforcement learning (RL) = Refining behaviour as the agent goes / learning from failure ( finding the right answer ) 

## Possible Application
- vaste applicability 
- constrained to **Decision Making** Problems 
- Collaborative Human/Model Possibilities
